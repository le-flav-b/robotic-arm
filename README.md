## ðŸ¤– Robotic Arm â€” Work in Progress ðŸš§

Hi! This is my **first dive into the world of electronics and robotics**. Iâ€™m proud to present my project: a **1-meter tall, 5-DoF Robotic Arm** that Iâ€™ve been developing for "Innovate & Automate". I had this idea for a long time, and itâ€™s thanks to this contest that I finally got started! ðŸš€ While the arm isnâ€™t fully complete, the shape is there, and the biggest obstacles are behind me.

### ðŸŒŸ Project Highlights

- **ðŸ¦¾ 5 Degrees of Freedom:** Built for versatile movement with high adaptability.
- **ðŸŒŒ Massive Reach:** 1.7 meters of wingspan for a wide range of applications!
- **ðŸ“² Touchscreen Control (Coming Soon):** Currently testing with control inputs via Arduino, but I'm aiming for a sleek touch interface.
- **ðŸ§© Interchangeable End-Effector System (Planned):**  
  The true *final boss* of this project! Hereâ€™s the concept:
  - **Automatic Tip Recognition**: RFID-tagged tips are recognized instantly.
  - **Power Control**: 5V, 12V, and 2xPWM outputs to add functionalities (e.g., grippers, tools) to each tip with magnetic connectors.
  - **3-Servo Locking Mechanism**: Effortless tip switching without manual attachment.

*(Currently, I have the servos and RFID reader functional, and I'm working on the head design.)*

### ðŸ‘¥ Feedback & Support

I'm just starting out in robotics, and this first project has already taught me a lot about electronics and project design through trial and error. However, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ve missed things along the way. **If you have any feedback, tips, or advice, Iâ€™d love to hear them!**

Thank you for checking out my project! A big thank you to this contest for motivating me to carry out an idea that had been in my head for almost a year and a half and which I was finally able to bring to life! ðŸ¥³
